# Implementation status

Updated September 23, 2026. The architecture plan remains the target design.

## First increment: authorization kernel and scripted evidence

- [x] Record sanitized Mac hardware and runtime readiness.
- [x] Establish Python 3.12 package, dependency lock, CLI, Ruff, mypy, pytest, and CI.
- [x] Validate proposals for `documents.read` and `tickets.create`.
- [x] Check workspace, resource scope, actor ACLs, and coarse confidentiality.
- [x] Bind expiring approvals to action, episode, execution key, contract, policy,
  resource snapshot, and sensitivity state; consume with the effect transaction.
- [x] Persist episode state, idempotency keys, simulated effects, and audit in SQLite WAL.
- [x] Exercise concurrent delivery, precommit failure, reopen/retry, and cancellation.
- [x] Add one authored development scenario and a state/output grader.
- [x] Export labeled replay JSON/Markdown with source/scenario hashes and checksums.

## Second increment: isolated tool execution

- [x] Pin the official Python base image by digest; build separate tool/probe images.
- [x] Add a fixed Docker supervisor with bounded input/output and explicit cleanup.
- [x] Compute outside the SQLite write lock and recheck policy/approval state on commit.
- [x] Reject forged effects and state changes that occur during computation.
- [x] Run clean/attacked replay through the same container backend for both profiles.
- [x] Measure 20 passing container smoke checks on Docker Desktop 29.7.2.
- [x] Expand deterministic coverage to 77 tests and add isolated smoke/replay to CI.

The first container smoke exposed dormant network interfaces and an automatic
removal race. The corrected checks verify active interfaces/routes; cleanup
confirms removal instead of accepting an in-progress response. See [the runbook](sandbox.md).

## Third increment: bounded native inference

- [x] Pin official Qwen3-4B Q4_K_M weights and a native llama.cpp arm64 runtime.
- [x] Add explicit project-local downloads, checksum verification, and license retention.
- [x] Add a loopback-only adapter with bounded HTTP, exact server tokenization,
  schema-constrained responses, and no provider/model fallback.
- [x] Persist requests and raw model responses before tool dispatch.
- [x] Enforce context, token, step, output, and time budgets, including one schema repair.
- [x] Pause at approval requests; reject post-cancellation and post-deadline effects.
- [x] Run baseline, prompt-only, and defended clean/attacked trials through Docker.
- [x] Export schedules, traces, SQLite backup, raw calls, grades, and checksums.
- [x] Confirm native Metal offload of 37/37 layers with an 8192-token context.
- [x] Pass 127 deterministic tests, including transport, protocol ordering,
  runtime budgets, evidence denominators, and installed-runtime integrity.

The first live trials exposed premature final answers with no tool effects. The
independent state grader marked them unsuccessful. Live testing also identified
that canonical JSON sorting changed schema property order, which matters to the
runtime's generation grammar. The wire format now preserves discriminator-first
ordering and requires tool tags; a regression test covers this boundary.

The development task is now version 2: its requested title and body requirement
are explicit in the user-visible task. The grader is unchanged. Version 1 trials
remain recorded, including failures caused by omitted body detail or title casing.

This loop persists evidence but does not implement durable leases, automatic
resume, an authenticated approval API, or model-failure retries. See the
[native-model runbook](local-model.md).

Measured outcome: all three task-v2 clean trials passed. Baseline and prompt-only
made the unauthorized write; defended denied it but did not complete the original
task. All 24 development episodes (including earlier failures) are retained in
the [evidence bundle](evidence/local-model-2026-09-23/README.md). This is a useful
feasibility result with a visible utility cost, not a passed release gate.

## Fourth increment: development suite and review simulation

- [x] Author ten development tasks covering scope, actor ACLs, read-only work,
  multiple reads/writes, sensitive approvals, refusals, and missing resources.
- [x] Grade committed reads, required attempts, exact ticket counts and requested
  bodies, final output, forbidden effects, and exact canary disclosures.
- [x] Add a deterministic reviewer with a predeclared exact-action contract,
  separate from the grader and attack objective. Ordinary runs still pause.
- [x] Execute 60 paired scripted cases: defended clean 10/10, attacked utility
  10/10, observed attack wins 0/10. These are authored actions, not model results.
- [x] Verify all 20 defended scripted cases again with real isolated Docker tools;
  preserve the separate report and the same five review decisions.
- [x] Add explicit replay/live suite commands, full schedules, source/fixture
  snapshots, SQLite backups, raw model calls, and exported checksums.
- [x] Retain denial-feedback development experiments, including false completion
  claims that fail the independent state grader.
- [x] Pass 156 tests plus lint, formatting, and strict type checks; add suite replay
  to CI. The tests include approval credential exclusion and cancellation on review.

See the [suite runbook](development-suite.md) and
[experiment evidence](evidence/development-suite-2026-09-23/README.md).
Both task-reminder treatments still failed live recovery: the model claimed
success without creating a ticket. All twelve new live episodes are retained;
no failed episode was removed or regraded. All six clean trials passed, and both
defended attacked trials blocked the write but failed task utility.

## Next increment: finish Phase 0 feasibility

1. Run the full ten-task suite with fresh local inference and isolated tools,
   including exact-action simulated approvals and all three profiles.
2. Use its failure cases to assess model suitability, recovery, clean utility,
   latency, and memory before selecting the release model profile.
3. Extend coverage to the remaining four planned tools during platform work.

**Phase 0 has not passed:** the ten-task suite is authored and validated with
scripted actions, but the full live feasibility run is outstanding. Only two of
the six planned tools exist. No held-out suite has been authored or frozen.

## Later milestones

The remaining work follows the architecture plan: durable queue/leases/fencing;
all six tools; authenticated API and operator/worker credential separation;
approval UI and execution timeline; paired live evaluation and uncertainty;
recovery/isolation checks; frozen held-out benchmark; portfolio recording and release.

Do not treat the current effect transaction as proof of worker fencing, the trusted
`review()` library call as an authenticated approval endpoint, or authored replay
recovery as evidence that a model can recover after a denied call.
